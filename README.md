### Hi there 👋

I'm a final-year PhD student working on **learning-based 3D reconstruction**, with growing interests across the broader landscape of **generative AI**.

- 🔭 Research interests include:
  - **3D vision** – reconstruction, neural rendering, visual SLAM  
  - **Generative models** – across 1D (time series), 2D (images, video), and 3D (geometry, scenes)  
  - **Representation learning** – with an emphasis on structured and spatial domains  

- 🤝 I'm open to collaborations and idea exchanges in any of these areas
